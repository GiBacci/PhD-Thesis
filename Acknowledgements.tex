\chapter{Acknowledgements}

First of all I would like to thank my supervisors: Professor \textbf{Alessio Mengoni} and Doctor \textbf{Anna Benedetti} for their constant presence and contagious enthusiasm.

I also would like to thank the COMBO (Florence computational biology group) in the persons of \textbf{Marco Galardini}, \textbf{Marco Fondi} and \textbf{Emanuele Bosi} for their advices and all discussions made over an old whiteboard.

Many thanks to \textbf{Francesco Vitali} for sharing with me the experience of a PhD in the Department of Biology of the Florence University.

Thanks to all of those who have gravitated around the Specola and Sesto Fiorentino during these years, and especially \textbf{Alice Checcucci}, \textbf{Isabel Maida}, \textbf{Elena Perrin}, \textbf{Angela Frascella}, \textbf{Giulia Spini} and \textbf{Amaranta Focardi} for all the good laughs.

Many thanks to my family which has always supported me in all these long years of neverending studies: I wouldn't have made it without their presence.

Last but not least, thanks to \textbf{Adele Giannetti} for standing by me every time I was not-so-enthusiastic about what was going on.
